### Angular vs React vs Vue
* * *
- While researching the best framework to move forward with, we looked into the 3 most popular frameworks, weighing out the advantages and disadvantages. While many enterprises use Angular and the community backing for it is substantial,  the learning curve is a bit higher due to having to learn TypeScript. It's out of the box bloat also gives it a disadvantage as we'd rather pick the packages that we need for our application. While Vue is a nice framework and hands down the easiest of the 3 to use, support for it is nowhere near that of React and Angular. At this point it is also really geared toward small biz owners and micropreneurs, not enterprises. That leads us to React....

### What is React?
* * *
- React is simply a JavaScript library to build reusable UI Components.
	- Buttons, Modals, Dropdowns, Lists, Media, etc..
- It is backed by a pretty big company, Facebook and has grown traction as the years have passed.
- What started as a hip new framework has now transformed into the standard framework when building out the front-end.
- Numbers: In 2020 alone, there were nearly 160,000 projects built with Angular compared to a whopping 692K in React
- React takes the JS, HTML, and CSS of applications and bundle them up into one piece

### What makes React the obvious choice?
* * *
- React makes it easy to make reusable 'view components'. Basically, once you have created a component of a page (navbar, footer, sidebar, etc), you are able to reuse it anywhere else.
- This makes it easier to build modular applications. React is simply a lot of smaller components combined into larger pieces, until you have an entire application
- React is much more of a library than a framework in the sense that it comes barebones and you add in the packages that you actually need. Angular is more of framework. It comes with a lot of things, many times things that aren't being utilized for projects

### Is React Future-Proof?
* * *
- The way technology moves, you can never be certain anything will be around in the future, but if I had to take an estimated guess, based on our findings, React is the right choice. The fact that it is being backed by a large corporation and being used my a large community of developer, I think it's safe to say we made a good choice as it relates to technology.

### Ease of Use/Complications
* * *
- To get started with React, one would simply need access to the docs and the terminal. It is very lightweight out of the box and allows you to add tools/packages as needed.

### Examples of Companies Usage of Each Framework
* * *
- Facebook
- Instagram(Acquired by FB in 2012)
- React(2014)
- Atlassian
- Disney+
- WhatsApp (Web)

### Managing Application State(Component Memory)
* * *
Since React apps are comprised of a bunch of smaller components, when a user performs an action and changes the state of a component, it can have an impact on the state of our other components. Not a big deal when working on a small app, but it becomes very complex as application size grows. From a technical perspective, it doesn't make sense to use only one when they were meant to compliment one another, so we will use both Redux and React Hooks together to address state management and scalability challenges. 
* Redux - Global State object, also called the 'store', for including all states in the app and updates them when necessary.Needed for more complicated state management.
* Hooks - Local State. Great for small to mid-sized apps
